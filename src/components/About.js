			<h2>Why We Started:</h2>
			<p>
				I always loved churros since little and when we just to go to Tijuana
				with my kids one of them Andrew always wanted churros when we were at
				boarder but he couldn’t pronounce Churros he will say chulos his r r
				were not coming out and I will tell him say churros and I will buy you
				some he tried and I always bought him anyway so I decided I wanted my
				own churro company so I decided to give it a try I search for the right
				cart something that will caught the eye I found this one in my own home
				town so here Iam doing good and better every day reception it’s original
				from Spain
