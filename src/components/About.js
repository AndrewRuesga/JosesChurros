			<h2>How We Are Different: </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Yes I order it I flew to Guadalajara and had it custom made and was
					shipped to Tijuana and I went to pick it up
				</li>
				<li>
					The difference it’s a vintage style versus just a regular cart with
					little wheels more appealing I make the churros from scratch and cook
					in front of you NOT BOUGHT say store frozen like other vendors
				</li>
				<li>
					I stop freezing them it takes longer so we just make them fresh it’s
					worth the wait for customers
				</li>
				<li>
					I cook them then transfer to a drip pan so they won’t have lots oil
					and then we smothered them with sugar and cinnamon original style and
					if the want it gourmet we place them in a paper boat and topped with
					whip cream and choice of syrup that are made from scratch
				</li>
				<li>No warmers </li>
				<li>
					Chocolate strawberry or caramel. We make the syrup ones a week shelve
					life can be 10 days so we make enough for time
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Why We Started:</h2>
			<p>
				I always loved churros since little and when we just to go to Tijuana
				with my kids one of them Andrew always wanted churros when we were at
				boarder but he couldn’t pronounce Churros he will say chulos his r r
				were not coming out and I will tell him say churros and I will buy you
				some he tried and I always bought him anyway so I decided I wanted my
				own churro company so I decided to give it a try I search for the right
				cart something that will caught the eye I found this one in my own home
				town so here Iam doing good and better every day reception it’s original
				from Spain
